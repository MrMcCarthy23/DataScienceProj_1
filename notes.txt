train a modle to predict the success of a question (the number of clicks and the cost per click) based on the data set.



DATA MATERIALS:
	- rank
	- question string content
	- global clicks/time
	- global avg cost per click

WHAT QUESTIONS TO ASK(EDA):
	- what are the common substrings in the questions
	- what substrings yield the highest cost per click
	- is there a correlation between the cost per click and the rank
	- is there a correlation between the rank and the common substrings
	- what is the avg "revenue" ( cost per click*(clicks/time))
	- is there a correlation between the avg revenue and the rank
	- is there a correlation between question length and rank
	- what are the trending subjects in the questions 
	- is there a correlation between the subjects and the cost per click
	- 


HOW TO BUILD THE MODLE:
+PREDICTING THE NUMBER OF CLICKS
	- this is going to be a linear regression problem
	- rank all the words in the data set 
		> based on notes page cs697ak
			~ now we have a list of keywords ranked by the number of clicks they have recieved
			~ we can use this as a lable for the individual keywords in a new question
			~ how do we handle words we have not seen before?
				+ possibly use clustering to predict the subject of the word and assign an avg weight to the new keyword
					- find a subject clustering modle on github and see if I can fit it to my needs
						>
					- use this modle to break the data set into subjects
